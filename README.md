# Enigmas Box - Final project

## Purpose 
Enigma’s Box is an “escape room” themed game with modifications. This project serves a purpose to save time in the line by allowing the user to create their reservation where an available slot is displayed. The user basically goes on the site/app to check out what time slots are available to hold for themselves.
